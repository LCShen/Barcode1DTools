UNDER DEVELOPMENT

This is an implementation of 1D barcodes in Ruby.  Code currently works
to generate and decode Code 3 of 9, Code 93, Code 11, Codabar,
Interleaved 2 of 5 (I 2/5), COOP 2 of 5, Matrix 2 of 5, Industrial 2 of
5, IATA 2 of 5, PostNet, EAN-13, EAN-8, UPC-A, UPC-E, UPC Supplemental
2, and UPC Supplemental 5 symbologies.  The complete library is under
development, but this code works fine.  I will add more symbologies and
unit tests for each as time permits.

There is currently a fairly complete Perl implementation at:

https://github.com/mdchaney/barcodes

I believe those work fine, but consider it legacy code.  If you would
like to help in porting over any of the symbologies there please let me
know.  I would love to receive patches :)
