UNDER DEVELOPMENT

This is an implementation of 1D barcodes in Ruby.  Code currently works
to generate Interleaved 2 of 5 (I 2/5) EAN-13, and UPC-A symbologies.
The complete library is under development, but this code works fine.  I
will add more codes and unit tests for each as time permits.

This code also includes the ability to decode bar patterns for EAN-13
and UPC-A codes.

There is currently a fairly complete Perl implementation at:

https://github.com/mdchaney/barcodes

I believe those work fine, but consider it legacy code.
