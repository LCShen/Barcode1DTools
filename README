UNDER DEVELOPMENT

This is an implementation of 1D barcodes in Ruby.  Code currently works
to generate and decode Code 128, Code 3 of 9, Code 93, Code 11, Codabar,
Interleaved 2 of 5 (I 2/5), COOP 2 of 5, Matrix 2 of 5, Industrial 2 of
5, IATA 2 of 5, PostNet, Plessey, MSI (Modified Plessey), EAN-13, EAN-8,
UPC-A, UPC-E, UPC Supplemental 2, and UPC Supplemental 5 symbologies.

This is a pretty complete set of 1D symbologies and most or all other
common symbologies are based on one of the above.  As of the 2000s most
bar code advancement is taking place in the 2D realm so it's unlikely
that anything more will come about.  Additionally, Code 128 is general
purpose and sufficiently compact and robust enough to cover any
application.

I also have a fairly complete Perl implementation at:

https://github.com/mdchaney/barcodes

I believe those work fine, but consider it legacy code.
